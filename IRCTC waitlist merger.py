"""3) Merge Sort — The IRCTC Waitlist Merger
IRCTC has two separately sorted waitlists — one from its mobile app, one from railway counters.
To produce a final unified waitlist, they don't re-sort from scratch.
They merge both sorted lists in one pass — compare the front of each list, pick the smaller token,
 and advance.
This is exactly merge sort's merge step."""
